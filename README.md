A common task in machine learning pipelines is encoding categorical variables for a given algorithm in a format that allows as much useful signal as possible to be captured.

Because this is such a common task and important skill to master, we've put together a dataset that contains only categorical features, and includes:

1. binary features 
2. low- and high-cardinality nominal features
3. low- and high-cardinality ordinal features
4. (potentially) cyclical features

The model for this competition, which is mentioned in the solution are LogisticRegression and Randomforestclassfier, although without much effort Randomforestclassifier is working good.
